// idea for hero section is to have 1/4 width of the section to be assigned to its logo and rest 3/4 to the text content
// and the text to be left aligned and the logo will be to the right of the section 
// and logo will be jin sakais clan logo from ghost of tsushima
// this is to be implemented later 
// and to also change the whole of the landing page design as of now its fine but still lacking the touch of modern saas landing page
//
